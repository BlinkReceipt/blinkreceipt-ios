# BlinkReceipt Integration Instructions

## Installation with CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for iOS, which automates and simplifies the process of using 3rd-party libraries like BlinkReceipt in your projects. If you do not have Cocoapods installed, see the [Getting Started Guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html#getting-started).

### Podfile

Here is a sample barebones `Podfile` which imports the BlinkReceipt pod:

```ruby
#You must include this additional source as the BlinkReceipt pod is hosted in a private spec repository
source 'https://github.com/BlinkReceipt/PodSpecRepo.git'
source 'https://cdn.cocoapods.org/'

platform :ios, '9.0'

target 'YourTarget' do
  use_frameworks!
  
  pod 'BlinkReceipt', '~> 1.8' 
end
```

After editing your `Podfile`, run `pod install` and then make sure to open the `.xcworkspace` file rather than the `.xcodeproj`

## Installation with Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a lightweight dependency manager for iOS. If you do not have Carthage installed see the [Quick Start](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#quick-start)

### Cartfile
```
binary "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlinkReceipt/blinkreceipt-ios/master/BlinkReceiptStatic.json"Â ~> 1.8
```

After editing your `Cartfile`, run `carthage update` and then add the framework to your project as described in the Quick Start above

## Standalone Installation

If you do not use a dependency manager:

- Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/BlinkReceipt/blinkreceipt-ios/releases) tab
- Unzip and drag `BlinkReceiptStatic.framework` into your XCode project
- In your target's settings, in the General tab, scroll down to `Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content` and change the `Embed` value for `BlinkReceiptStatic.framework` to `Embed & Sign`
